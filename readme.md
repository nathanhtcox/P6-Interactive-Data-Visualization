What is the difference between ‘full-time’ and ‘employed’?
‘Full-time’ should be a subset of ‘employed’ but it doesn’t appear to be?
Self-employed looks like it might be a subset of ‘employed’.
Full time people appear to fall into 2 categories, poor credit where their interest rate is variable, and good credit where their interest rate is low.
Almost all employed people have a credit score above 600.
How do I deselect so that I can change all the dots back to regular colour?
Can I select multiple colours instead of just 2?
A majority of the data points are either full-time or employed.
Colour contrast is good, blue and orange are easy to see against each other.
I like that it is interactive.
