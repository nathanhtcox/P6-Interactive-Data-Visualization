#Project 6 - Data Visualization with D3

##Summary


##Design
A scatter plot was chosen to give a rich sense of the number and distribution of data points while also communicating a trend in the data. Opacity and jitter were used to show the distribution of data points more clearly. Only 2 colours were used to keep the graphic simple, but buttons were added so the user can interact with the data and filter by employment status.

What is the difference between ‘full-time’ and ‘employed’?
‘Full-time’ should be a subset of ‘employed’ but it doesn’t appear to be?
Self-employed looks like it might be a subset of ‘employed’.
Full time people appear to fall into 2 categories, poor credit where their interest rate is variable, and good credit where their interest rate is low.
Almost all employed people have a credit score above 600.
How do I deselect so that I can change all the dots back to regular colour?
Can I select multiple colours instead of just 2?
A majority of the data points are either full-time or employed.
Colour contrast is good, blue and orange are easy to see against each other.
I like that it is interactive.

####Feedback 2
Can't tell if interest rate is 25% or 25 basis points. Credit score is obvious. 
2 common interest rates at 35%, 30%.
Employed seems to be have good credit and low interest rates. 
Not-available employment status seems to have very low credit scores.
It would be interesting to see an additional visualization that shows how many people are in each employment category.
Align the x axis ticks to multiples of 20 (every 40).
Add additional colours for the groups.

####Feedback 3
Is each data point a loan?
Why are some areas darker than the rest?
I haven't seen a visual representation like this before. My experience is with fewer participants.
I see a clear distribution that doesn't have too many outliers.
The bulk of the data points is at the center.
The higher the credit score, the lower the loan interest rate.
Fewer people were willing to loan to anyone with a low credit score.
Self-employed people have many fewer loans. Self-employed people seem to be represented across the spectrum of credit scores.
Not-available employment status seemed to have low credit scores.
People who are employed seem to report that they are employed as opposed to report "Not-available".
There are few people in part time or retired employment status.
